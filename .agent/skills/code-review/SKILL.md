# Instructions

## Review Checklist
When reviewing code, check for the following:

1.  **Correctness**: Does the code do what it's supposed to? Are there any logic errors?
2.  **Edge Cases**: Are error conditions and edge cases handled properly?
3.  **Style**: Does the code follow the project's style conventions and linting rules?
4.  **Performance**: Are there obvious performance inefficiencies?

## Feedback Guidelines
*   Be specific about compliance with the checklist.
*   Explain *why* a change is needed, not just *what*.
*   Suggest alternatives or improvements when possible.
